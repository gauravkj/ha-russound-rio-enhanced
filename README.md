# HA Russound RIO Enhanced

Enhanced Home Assistant integration for Russound RIO systems, built to improve support for real world multizone installations such as the SMZ16 PRE and MBX PRE.

## Why this exists

This project started from a real world issue where Home Assistant exposed only 1 zone for an SMZ16 PRE even though the controller supports 16 zones.

The root cause was traced to `aiorussound`, where the model was not recognized correctly for max zone discovery. A fix was developed, tested, and submitted upstream to aiorussound.

This repo provides a working custom integration layer for Russound based Home Assistant setups and a place for further feature enhancements.
